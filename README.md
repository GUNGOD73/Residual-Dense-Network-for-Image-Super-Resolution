# Residual-Dense-Network-for-Image-Super-Resolution
Developed a Residual Dense Network (RDN) for image restoration tasks, improving super-resolution, denoising, compression artifact reduction, and deblurring. Utilized Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs) for hierarchical feature extraction and applied local/global feature fusion, achieving superior results on benchmark datasets and real-world images.
